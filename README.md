Dimensionals is a Rust library for working with n-dimensional data. It provides a flexible and efficient multidimensional array implementation with a generic storage backend over generic number types.

## Features

- Generic over element type `T` (implementing `Num` and `Copy`), number of dimensions `N`, and storage backend `S`
- Support for Scalar (0D), Vector (1D), Matrix (2D), and Tensor (N>2 D) types
- Efficient `LinearArrayStorage` backend with support for row-major and column-major layouts
- Iterators (immutable and mutable) for efficient traversal
- Indexing and slicing operations
- Arithmetic operations (element-wise and scalar) with operator overloading
- Convenient macros for vector and matrix creation (`vector!` and `matrix!`)

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dimensionals = "0.1.0"
```

Here's a basic example of creating and using a matrix:

```rust
use dimensionals::{matrix, Dimensional, LinearArrayStorage};

fn main() {
    let m: Dimensional<i32, LinearArrayStorage<i32, 2>, 2> = matrix![
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]
    ];
    assert_eq!(m[[0, 0]], 1);
    assert_eq!(m[[1, 1]], 5);

    // Element-wise addition
    let m2 = &m + &m;
    assert_eq!(m2[[0, 0]], 2);
    assert_eq!(m2[[1, 1]], 10);

    // Scalar multiplication
    let m3 = &m * 2;
    assert_eq!(m3[[0, 0]], 2);
    assert_eq!(m3[[1, 1]], 10);

    // Iteration
    for &value in m.iter() {
        println!("{}", value);
    }
}
```

For more examples and usage details, see the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/dimensionals).

## Core Concepts

- **Element type `T`**: The type of data stored in the array (must implement `Num` and `Copy`).
- **Storage backend `S`**: The underlying storage mechanism for the array (must implement `DimensionalStorage`).
- **Number of dimensions `N`**: The dimensionality of the array (const generic parameter).

## Performance

The `LinearArrayStorage` backend stores elements in a contiguous `Vec<T>` and supports both row-major and column-major layouts. This provides good cache locality for traversals. The storage computes strides for efficient indexing.
